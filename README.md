# Advent-Of-Code-2022
This is a collection of my answers to the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge in Python.

I just started a new role at Microsoft, so I'll likely write some solutions in C# as well.

I try to write my python solutions as elegant, readable, and Pythonic as I can.
